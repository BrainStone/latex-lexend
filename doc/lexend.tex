\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this package is pretty straight forward:\\
The Lexend font collection has been designed by Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin to make
reading easier for everyone.\\
Now my goal is it to bring this wonderful collection to world of \hologo{LaTeX}.

\section{Acknowledgements}

I would like to take the time to thank everyone that helped me along my journey of creating this
package. It would not have been possible without every single one of you.

Special thanks to David Carlisle, Ulrike Fischer and Phelype Oleinik who helped me tremendously and
continuously in the \hologo{LaTeX} Stack Exchange chat. I really can't put it in words how much your
continued contributions and willingness to help helped me during the creation of this package.

Special thanks to Dr. Bonnie Shaver-Troup and Thomas Jockin for creating these fonts and allowing
people to have an easier time reading.

Consider this contribution to the great \hologo{LaTeX} community as my thank you to you all.

\section{Font samples}

While this whole document uses LexendDeca as the main font and LexendGiga as the sans font, it
doesn't hurt showing them off individually.\\
Each font will be shown off in the sizes \textsf{\textbackslash{}small},
\textsf{\textbackslash{}normalsize} and \textsf{\textbackslash{}large}.

\foreach \fontVariant in \lexendVariants
{
	\subsection{\fontspec{\fontVariant}{\fontVariant}}
	
	\fontspec{\fontVariant}{
		\small{\blindtext}\bigskip

		\normalsize{\blindtext}\bigskip

		\large{\blindtext}
	}
}
